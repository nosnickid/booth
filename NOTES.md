### 9/28

- More-or-less functional lightbulb tracking working
- Also tested with projector

To do next:
- send recordings to server and process into video
- UI for fullscreen, starting and stopping recording
- UI for emptying screen of gestures
- get more appealing cover for lightbulbs, tune detection parameters for it
- refactor code to make it a bit easier to tweak parameters of bulb detection
- decorate holders?
- test in more light conditions
- start making signs/decorations?
- performance optimization?
